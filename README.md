# TripletLoss
CNN Triplet Loss function implementation for matlab 

This is a matlab implementation of CNN triplet loss function, based 
 on the article "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition
    % and Clustering"  Google Inc 2015.
	
	This is only preliminary, and could be improved a lot.
	I would like to get any suggestions for optimize and improving the code
	
	Thanks
